Overview
--------

ggrepel provides geoms for [ggplot2] to repel overlapping text labels:

- `geom_text_repel()`
- `geom_label_repel()`

Text labels repel away from each other, away from data points, and away
from edges of the plotting area.

```r
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars))) +
  geom_text_repel() +
  geom_point(color = 'red') +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16)
```

Installation
------------

```r
# The easiest way to get ggrepel is to install it from CRAN:
install.packages("ggrepel")

# Or get the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("slowkow/ggrepel")

# Or use the install-github.me service
source("https://install-github.me/slowkow/ggrepel")
```

### Academic Papers

[An Efficient Algorithm for Scatter Chart Labeling][aaai]

Sebastian Theophil, Arno SchÃ¶dl

> This paper presents an efficient algorithm for a new variation of the point
> feature labeling problem. The goal is to position the largest number of point
> labels such that they do not intersect each other or their points. First we
> present an algorithm using a greedy algorithm with limited lookahead. We then
> present an algorithm that iteratively regroups labels, calling the first
> algorithm on each group, thereby identifying a close to optimal labeling
> order. The presented algorithm is being used in a commercial product to label
> charts, and our evaluation shows that it produces results far superior to
> those of other labeling algorithms.

This might be a good start for a revision of ggrepel.

### R

[directlabels]

> An extensible framework for automatically placing direct labels onto

> using Positioning Methods which can be re-used across several different
> plots. There are heuristics for examining "trellis" and "ggplot" objects

[wordcloud]

> Pretty word clouds.

The `wordcloud` package implements a spiraling algorithm to prevent text
labels from overlapping each other.

[FField]

> Force field simulation of interaction of set of points. Very useful for
> placing text labels on graphs, such as scatterplots.

I found that functions in the `FField` package were not ideal for repelling
overlapping rectangles, so I wrote my own.

See [this gist][1] for examples of how to use the `wordcloud` and `FField`
packages with `ggplot2`.
